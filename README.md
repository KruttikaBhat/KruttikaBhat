### Hello!
Welcome to my Github profile. I'm currently a graduate student at Stanford University. My research focuses on developing online math assessments for K-12 in order to identify struggling learners. I'm also interested in the cognitive skills involved in reading and math, how this gets affected in children with learning difficulties, and translating this research to educational technology.
